The simplest way to “level-up” Fart Looper—while still keeping it a hacker-friendly playground rather than a polished consumer product—is to treat it as a **network-audio automation lab** instead of a one-trick gag.  The core routine (serve a clip, discover UPnP devices, fire SetURI → Play) already works; every improvement below expands creative range, developer insight, or runtime resilience without drifting into release engineering or hard-security territory.

**Turn the audio pipeline into a mini media engine.**
Bundle a few additional clips (short beeps, a two-second white-noise burst, a spoken “hello world”) and expose a developer toggle that cycles, randomises, or streams them sequentially.  Because NanoHTTPD can serve any byte stream, you can lazily transcode WAV or Ogg assets to MP3 on first launch and stash them in cache; the code exercise teaches background I/O, buffering and MIME negotiation, and it lets you prototype latency tests on different codecs.

**Instrument every phase with live metrics.**
Wire a simple in-app “dev HUD” that shows: time to bring the HTTP server up, SSDP round-trip latency, average SOAP response time and per-device success.  Present the data in a tiny Compose chart updated via Flow—no external analytics, just in-memory telemetry.  By watching the numbers change as you tweak time-outs or thread pools you’ll see exactly where the pipeline stalls on lossy Wi-Fi or congested subnets.

**Add multi-protocol discovery pluggability.**
Write a small strategy interface—`DeviceDiscoverer.discover(timeout): Flow<Device>`—and keep the existing Cling SSDP strategy as the default.  Then hack together secondary strategies: (1) mDNS queries for `_googlecast._tcp` to reach Chromecasts that ignore UPnP, (2) a brute-force TCP banner scan on ports 7000 or 8009, (3) Bluetooth A2DP enumeration on Android 12+ if you want to blast farts into wireless headphones.  Each strategy streams devices into a common “bus”; the UI can show which protocol found what, and developers get a playground for protocol experiments.

**Merge “auto-run” with a rules engine.**
Instead of a single checkbox that fires every time Wi-Fi connects, let developers create lightweight rules: *“If SSID matches Home-Lab and between 8 p.m.–11 p.m., loop clip #2 five times”* or *“On the office network, never auto-run but keep manual launch.”*  A JSON rules file interpreted by a tiny DSL (think `when: "ssid =~ /lab/" and hour in 20..23"`) teaches parsing and scheduling while giving finer-grained demos.

**Introduce a faux-device simulator built into the app.**
Spin up a second NanoHTTPD instance exposing a skeleton UPnP description and AVTransport control endpoint that logs but never plays audio.  Running the simulator on the same phone or emulator lets you test discovery without another physical device.  It doubles as an educational stub: each time you send SOAP you can highlight what part of the XML matters.

**Go fully reactive.**
Port the imperative loop (`for device in devices { setUri; play }`) to Kotlin Flow chains so every device becomes a stream element.  Backpressure operators let you limit concurrency (“only two playbacks in flight”) and retry with `retryWhen`.  You’ll learn structured concurrency while slashing boilerplate.

**Expose an ADB shell interface for power users.**
Add an `android:exported="true"` Service intent that accepts `am startservice -a com.example.fartlooper.RUN --ei repeat 3 --es clip beep.mp3`.  It’s trivial Android plumbing but lets you orchestrate tests from CI, Termux, or Automate scripts without ever touching the GUI.

**Make failures audible.**
When any device errors out, schedule the phone’s loudspeaker to play a short “sad trombone” clip so the developer instantly hears that something didn’t fire.  You’ll exercise local audio output APIs and gain real-time feedback while wandering the office triggering loops.

**Document every finding as code comments.**
Instead of burying observations in a separate read-me, drop micro-essays right beside the tricky lines—why `MX=1` works for most Sonos players, how Chromecast chooses 8008 vs 8009, or what happens when you send Play before SetURI.  Future hackers reading the source grasp protocol oddities immediately.
